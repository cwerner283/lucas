# Lucas

Lucas is a lightweight Python project that demonstrates asynchronous task orchestration. It uses APScheduler to run jobs, provides WebSocket broadcasting, and includes helpers such as rate limiting, retry logic, and a simple JSON-based cache. The repository serves as a template for experimenting with scheduled data pipelines like trend discovery.
